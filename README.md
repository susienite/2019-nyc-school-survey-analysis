Summary of Findings & Interpretations: 
* Most NYC school teachers in 2019 completed the survey for their school. According to the boxplot, low teacher response rate were outliers.
* Many schools had about a 50% response rate from parents, resulting in a median of 56% and a mean of 55%. 
* 720 out of the 1829 schools did not have students complete the survey. Still, the median of the total student response rate was 69%, which indicates that response rate was high in schools that did require students to complete the survey.
* Most scores (Collaborative Teacher, Effective Leadership, Rigorous Instruction, Strong Family-Community connection) had a symmetric distribution with a very slight left-skew around 3.6-3.8. This enforces that most scores were in the upper range, but there is a greater variation in score ranges for lower scores. 
* The average scores for all categories were around 3.6-3.7, with the mean just slightly lower than the median.
* Overall Interpretation of Scores: </br>
There seems to be a consistent perception of strong performance across these four areas, but there may be some room for improvement. Most respondants perceive the school as performing slightly above to above average  across all four categories.
